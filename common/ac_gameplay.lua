---Tries to grabs camera for script to control it. If successfull, returns instance of `ac.GrabbedCamera` which you can then use to
---move camera, rotate it and alter some of its properties like DOF, FOV or exposure. However, if any other scripts are
---controlling camera currently, returns `nil` and a detailed error message with the name of script currently holding camera (with
---the reason to do so if provided) as a second argument.
---@param reason string|nil @Optional comment for the reason for grabbing camera, to simplify possible conflicts resolution.

---Camera holder, for scripts to move camera in their own custom way. Obtained by calling `ac.grabCamera()`. When script is done with
---its camera movement, call `:dispose()` to release camera back to Assetto Corsa. If any reference to an instance of active holder
---is lost and `ac.GrabbedCamera` gets garbage collected, camera is also released.
---
---To move camera, access `.transform` property and edit it directly, setting new camera position and orientation vectors. Note:
---although matrix gives you access to `.side` and `.up` vectors, you donâ€™t have to set them explicitly: before applying, matrix
---gets normalized automatically to make sure camera would not end up with a broken matrix.
---
---If you want to transition camera smoothly, use `.ownShare` property. It defaults to 1, but if set to 0.5, for example,
---resulting camera position would be in the middle of camera position set by AC and camera position set by script. If below 1,
---AC would also update camera position based on its current mode, once `.ownShare` reaches 1, CSP would switch current camera mode
---to free camera (switching back to original camera mode once `.ownShare` gets smaller).
---@class ac.GrabbedCamera
---@field transform mat4x4 @Camera transformation which will be applied with the next frame.
---@field transformOriginal mat4x4 @Camera transformation from original AC camera behaviour. Use `.ownShare` to smoothly transition between two, or access it here directly.
---@field fov number @Vertical FOV to be applied next frame, in degrees. Note: it would not affect camera in VR mode.
---@field fovOriginal number @Original camera vertical FOV, in degrees.
---@field dofDistance number @DOF distance to be applied next frame, in meters. Has an effect if `.dofFactor` is above 0. Requires YEBIS to work.
---@field dofDistanceOriginal number @Original camera DOF distance, in degrees.
---@field dofFactor number @DOF factor to be applied next frame. To get DOF to work, set it to 1.
---@field dofFactorOriginal number @Original camera DOF factor.
---@field exposure number @Camera exposure to be applied next frame.
---@field exposureOriginal number @Original camera exposure.
---@field ownShare number @Value for mixing original and custom camera parameters. Default value: 1. If 0, camera is controlled by Assetto Corsa. If 1, parameters set in `ac.GrabbedCamera` are used. If 0.5, parameters are mixed evenly.
---@field cameraRestoreThreshold number @Camera switches to original mode (for rendering logic) once `ownShare` drops below this value.
